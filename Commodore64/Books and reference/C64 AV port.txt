>  Can anyone tell me the pin-out of the c64 video port
 
Mairsil,
Here is the A/V connector of the C64 and C128 shown facing the rear of
the computer. Note that early versions of the C64 have a 5 pin DIN 
connector while later versions have an 8 pin. The two are wired exactly
the same, except that the 8 pin connector has a separated chroma (color)
output. Earlier C64's didn't output separate Y/C video. 

    no connection -----8           7-----no connection
                             6---------chroma out
       audio out -----3             1----- luminance (B & W signal)

          audio in -----5         4----- composite video out
                             2----- ground
